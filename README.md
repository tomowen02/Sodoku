# Soduku

This is a Sudoku game and solver.

The solving aspect makes use of recursive backtracking.

The program is also able to generate different completely unique sudoku puzzles, with only one possible solution.

This project is primarily a GUI application, however a textbased version existed mainly for debugging.

The GUI is built using pygame.
